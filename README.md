Readme for Kelvin Cuesta Arcadia React Take Home exercise. Will develop a small React CRUD application for contact management.

## Running the application/setup
**TO BE FILLED**

### Goals
1. Fully comprehend the server,tests, and the faker package.
2. Hit MVP features.
3. Bundle the front end and server together. (Parcel vs Webpack)
4. Make it pretty/accessible/responsive (will use Tachyons UI Framework)
5. Consider tests for my front end application and edge cases
6. Consider stretch goals and include in notes section below


### Plan/Initial Thought Process 
First plan of attack is to understand the server/routes, the faker package, and what data I am receiving from the server and what I need to send.

Second, get the core CRUD functionality/MVP features for the client, starting with the display and what calls to make to the server.

I intend to use Parcel to achieve goal number 3, the CRUD app has basic requirements and I do not imagine it needing the exhaustive options webpack provides. Using parcel, would probably make it easy to setup and run both server and app together.

I found this UI framework *Tachyons* that I enjoyed using previously and intend to use it to make the app responsive, accessible, and look good. It hits all those goals.

Finally, if I have time I would like to write tests for the different React components, and last write down what I didn't get to doing/what may be different at scale.
